# FunFactsBlog

This is my first full-stack project: a fun facts blog.

## Development

This little blog was built with Node,Express, MongoDB and Mongoose on the backend and with a little splash of Vanilla JS on the frontend.

### Features

You can read fun facts and you can add a new fact.
You can edit and delete a fact, and you can also filter facts by category, edit a category name or delete a whole category of facts.

## Running the project

1. Don't forget tu run "npm install" in the terminal (at the root of the project) :)
2. In the "index.js" file you should replace the "MONGO_URI" value with your own MongoDB connection information (you can get it by clicking "Connect" on your MongoDB cluster information page)
