# FunFactsBlog

This is my first full-stack project: a fun facts blog.

## Development

This little blog was built with Node,Express, MongoDB and Mongoose on the backend and with a little splash of Vanilla JS on the frontend.

## Features and requirements

- [x] On the homepage you can see the 3 most recent facts
- [x] All the facts are displayed on a separate page
- [x] Add a new fact
- [x] Edit / Delete a fact
- [x] Filter by category
- [ ] Add a new category
- [x] Edit the name of a category
- [x] Delete a category

I made it so that the only way to add a category would be if you write a new fun fact and contribute to the page :)

## Running the project

1. Don't forget tu run "npm install" in the terminal (at the root of the project) :)
2. In the "index.js" file you should replace the "MONGO_URI" value with your own MongoDB connection information (you can get it by clicking "Connect" on your MongoDB cluster information page)
